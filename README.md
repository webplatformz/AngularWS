# Challenge 3

We want to create a page with some accordions containing information about the planets in our solar system.

Take a look at the HTML & open the page in your browser.



###Task:

So everyone is happy with the two accordions, and because they look so cool, everyone wants more of them!

We can already see that there is quite a lot of duplicated HTML for the accordions. At the bottom of the index.html you
can see an idea about how the accordion items could be put inside a directive. Of course you can do it any other way
you prefer, as long as we don't need to duplicate code!


## Hints
The directive we propose requires ```ng-transclude```. If you have never heard of this, try a different solution that
is more familiar to you or have a look at [this example].
