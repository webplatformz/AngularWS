# Challenge 1
To get started we've set up a simple case with tests for the controller. Unfortunately the tests are failing...

### Task 1
Fix the unit tests and make the cat happy. 

```sh
$ npm test
```

### Task 2
This one is a bit more tricky. Now you've fixed the unit tests and the code seems to be working fine, but the webtest is failing! Can you see the problem?

```sh
$ npm webtest
```



#### Hints
- Difference between defining and extending a module 
- Scope inheritance (ng-if)
