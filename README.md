# Angular 15 to 5 Challenge
Workshop for intermediate angular developer and architects. The workshop is set up with challenges where you have to solve lifelike problems and requirements. Each challenge is designed to have 15min for solving the given tasks while 5min are reserved for review of the/any solution - that's why call it a "15 to 5" challenge.

###Initial Setup:
Welcome to our angular challenge. In this first step, you have a basic, *working* setup of the challenge. The angular-app currently consists of:

- `angularws-app` module definition in `app.js`
- `injection` module definition in `controllers.js`, which also contains the controller `injectionController`

The dependencies are as follows:

`angularws-app` -> `injection`

The `injectionTest.js` asserts the simple `$scope` variables on the `injectionController`, make sure it's green! Instructions below.

Have a look at the folder structure as well. Make sure you have understood the setup before we dive into the first challenge.
