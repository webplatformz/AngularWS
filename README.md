# Challange 2
In this challenge it's all about performance. The page should render thousands of prime number as fast as possible.

### Task 1:
With the initial setup the rendering of the first 1000 prime numbers takes quite some time. On a normal system it takes about 9 second to calculate and render the first 1000 primes.

Reduce that time as much as you can.

#### Profilers:
We included a simple profile that will help you analyze what is taking time in your app. Check the *Profiles* Tab from the Chrome Dev-Tools.

#### Hints: 
Check JavaScript functions; Binding.

```sh
$ npm start
