# Challenge 1
To get started we've set up a simple case with tests for the controller. Unfortunately the two tests are failing...

### Task 1
Fix the test and make the cat happy. Check if everything works as intended (is it possible to hide the answer?).

```sh
$ npm test
```

#### Hints
Know the difference between defining and extending a module; Directives and scope inheritance;
